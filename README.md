# Common-Noise-Detection

- Common Noise Detection System where the system detects the noises in our surroundings and records them in real-time.
- When there is no noise in the surrounding, the system stops and wait for the new noise. During this period the system stops the recording process and will record it once again when a new noise is detected.
- Can fine-tune the system parameters where users can specify a certain wait time interval, Frame specification, and others.
- This system is developed using the `Python` programming language and `PyAudio` Library.
